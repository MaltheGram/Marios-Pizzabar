REMARKS:


Error handling:

Has only been done in parts of the code, as per agreement with Nicklas.
Program is not able to handle situations, where user input is invalid. fx. pizza nr is smaller than 1, or larger than last pizza's nr.


Extra feature, that didn't get added, because it wasn't a requirement:

If customer doesn't specify a pick up time, it could have defaulted to one hour ahead.
Team could have suggested this feature, to nurture a good relationship with the customer,
in order to get the contract for making a website for him in the future.
